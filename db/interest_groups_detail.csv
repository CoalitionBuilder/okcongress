Proposals to severely restrict imports into the United States were moving through the Congress. Threats of retaliation by foreign nations were being openly voiced. These business representatives felt that a combination of restrictions and retaliations could destroy two decades of progress in the expansion of trade and investment and would damage other areas of international cooperation. To help prevent this they formed the Emergency Committee for American Trade. The bills then in Congress did not succeed but the threat to trade and investment continued and the founders of what came to be known as ECAT were joined by others until the Committee reached its present size. ECAT's members account for major segments of the manufacturing financial processing merchandising and publishing sectors of the American economy. Their combined exports run into the tens of billions of dollars. The jobs they provide for American men and women -- including the jobs accounted for by suppliers dealers and subcontractors -- are located in every state and cover skills of all levels. Their annual worldwide sales exceed $1.5 trillion and they employ approximately four million persons. The members of ECAT are practical business people. They are not free trade theorists. They believe in and support measures designed to promote economic growth through the expansion of international trade and investment. ECAT members are active supporters of legislative and other measures that facilitate U.S. trade and investment. They additionally are opposed to changes in U.S. trade and tax law that unfairly penalize their competitiveness in world markets. ECAT members support the continued expansion of the multilateral trading system to provide new opportunities for farmers manufacturers and service providers and to improve compliance with agreements to protect intellectual property rights. They also encourage business people overseas to support policies that assure fairer treatment of American goods in foreign markets and to oppose restrictions on U.S. companies. Members of ECAT supported by experts from within their companies and from the small ECAT staff have made their views known through testimony before Congressional committees through contacts with members of Congress and Administration officials through liaison with other organizations and through public information programs including ECAT’s Trade: Discover the OpportunityTM trade outreach program and the Mainstay monograph series on the contribution of U.S. trade and foreign direct investment to the U.S. economy.

NRA-PVF also endorsed thousands of state legislative candidates that same year and achieved an 84% success rate in those elections. NRA resources in the 2008 elections were more widely deployed in more critical battles than ever before. Millions of dollars were spent on direct campaign donations independent campaign expenditures and on mobilizing the most aggressive grassroots operation in NRA history. In 2009 and '10 NRA-ILA has continued to build upon that grassroots organization with programs that work to effectively communicate with NRA members and others. NRA relies on a very simple premise: when provided with the facts the nation's elected officials will recognize that "gun control" schemes are an infringement on the Second Amendment and a proven failure in fighting crime. The importance of this premise lies in the knowledge that as one U.S. Congressman put it: 'The gun lobby is people.'"
