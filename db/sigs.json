The Resolve staff meet regularly with Members of Congress and Administration officials, coordinating their efforts with those of other human rights, humanitarian, and faith-based organizations who share our commitment to peace. And most importantly, The Resolve facilitates nationwide campaigns to motivate political leaders to make ending the LRA crisis a genuine priority and to guide their efforts in policy making.

To build the seniority of women in Congress by electing women at a young age. WUFPAC was started in January 1999 by a group of young women, representing diverse political and geographic backgrounds, gathered together in Washington, DC to discuss the role of young women in politics. Recognizing that political capital is built by political tenure and frustrated by the low percentage of women currently holding political office, they created WUFPAC to support the efforts of young women running for Congress and statewide offices. WUFPAC was incorporated as a Washington, DC non-profit corporation in January 1999 and filed its statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission soon thereafter. The first WUFPAC executive board was assembled in the early months of 1999. WUFPAC has been active in political cycles since 2002."],

We are continually making investments to help women develop political skills and cultivate resources so that we can bring more women into politics and elected office. Only then can we build a lasting progressive majority dedicated to social justice, civil rights, diversity, economic reform, and compassion -- and construct a society that values the contributions of all of its citizens.

In the decades that followed, we expanded the scope of our work to address many other areas of animal suffering. Today, one of our greatest areas of emphasis is cruel animal factories, which raise and slaughter pigs, cows, chickens and other animals. The biggest are in our country, and they are expanding worldwide. AWI's 50th Anniversary CompilationAnother major AWI effort is our quest to end the torture inflicted on furbearing animals by steel jaw leghold traps and wire snares. AWI continues its work to protect animals in laboratories including promotion of development of non-animal testing methods and prevention of painful experiments on animals by high school students. Representatives of AWI regularly attend meetings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora to fight for protection of threatened and endangered species. Similarly, we attend meetings of the International Whaling Commission to preserve the ban on commercial whaling, and we work to protect all marine life against the proliferation of human-generated ocean noise including active sonar and seismic air guns. AWI works to minimize the impacts of all human actions detrimental to endangered species, including the destruction of natural forests containing ancient trees, and pollution of the oceans destroying every kind of marine life. As of 2013, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation officially changed its name to the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI). - Project Vote Smart"],

The Republican Study Committee is dedicated to a limited and Constitutional role for the federal government, a strong national defense, the protection of individual and property rights, and the preservation of traditional family values. The group has played a major role in key policy areas including budget, appropriations, taxes, education, Social Security reform, defense, deregulation, and general government reform. The Republican Study Committee is an independent research arm for Republicans. The RSC was founded to serve as an ideological rallying point where like-minded conservatives can coordinate their activities and stand on the basis of principle  where a minority of committed men and women without years of seniority or formal leadership positions can affect change. They can do it on their first day in Congress. They can do it by coming up with a sound policy idea and by articulating a powerful position in debate. They can do it by serving actively in the RSC and by making it their home and family during their tenure in Congress. The House Conservatives Fund (HCF) is a non-connected federal PAC supported by more than 100 fiscally and socially conservative Members of Congress who seek to elect the next generation of conservative leaders. Our mission is two-fold: 1. To maintain the conservative Republican majority in Congress. 2. To assure that principled conservatives are elected (and re-elected)."],

        "description": ["In October 1967, a number of United States business leaders joined together because of a shared concern that a new worldwide trade war was in the making. Proposals to severely restrict imports into the United States were moving through the Congress. Threats of retaliation by foreign nations were being openly voiced. These business representatives felt that a combination of restrictions and retaliations could destroy two decades of progress in the expansion of trade and investment and would damage other areas of international cooperation. To help prevent this, they formed the Emergency Committee for American Trade. The bills then in Congress did not succeed but the threat to trade and investment continued, and the founders of what came to be known as ECAT were joined by others until the Committee reached its present size. ECAT's members account for major segments of the manufacturing, financial, processing, merchandising, and publishing sectors of the American economy. Their combined exports run into the tens of billions of dollars. The jobs they provide for American men and women -- including the jobs accounted for by suppliers, dealers, and subcontractors -- are located in every state and cover skills of all levels. Their annual worldwide sales exceed $1.5 trillion, and they employ approximately four million persons. The members of ECAT are practical business people. They are not free trade theorists. They believe in and support measures designed to promote economic growth through the expansion of international trade and investment. ECAT members are active supporters of legislative and other measures that facilitate U.S. trade and investment. They additionally are opposed to changes in U.S. trade and tax law that unfairly penalize their competitiveness in world markets. ECAT members support the continued expansion of the multilateral trading system to provide new opportunities for farmers, manufacturers, and service providers, and to improve compliance with agreements to protect intellectual property rights. They also encourage business people overseas to support policies that assure fairer treatment of American goods in foreign markets and to oppose restrictions on U.S. companies. Members of ECAT, supported by experts from within their companies and from the small ECAT staff, have made their views known through testimony before Congressional committees, through contacts with members of Congress and Administration officials, through liaison with other organizations, and through public information programs, including ECAT’s Trade: Discover the OpportunityTM trade outreach program and the Mainstay monograph series on the contribution of U.S. trade and foreign direct investment to the U.S. economy.

        "description": ["The NRA Political Victory Fund (NRA-PVF) is NRA's political action committee. The NRA-PVF ranks political candidates - irrespective of party affiliation - based on voting records, public statements and their responses to an NRA-PVF questionnaire. In 2008, NRA-PVF was involved in 271 campaigns for the U.S. House and Senate, winning in 230 of those races (85%). NRA-PVF also endorsed thousands of state legislative candidates that same year and achieved an 84% success rate in those elections. NRA resources in the 2008 elections were more widely deployed in more critical battles than ever before. Millions of dollars were spent on direct campaign donations, independent campaign expenditures and on mobilizing the most aggressive grassroots operation in NRA history. In 2009 and '10, NRA-ILA has continued to build upon that grassroots organization with programs that work to effectively communicate with NRA members and others. NRA relies on a very simple premise: when provided with the facts, the nation's elected officials will recognize that gun control schemes are an infringement on the Second Amendment and a proven failure in fighting crime. The importance of this premise lies in the knowledge that, as one U.S. Congressman put it: 'The gun lobby is people.'"],
