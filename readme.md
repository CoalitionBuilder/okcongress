With 535 Members of Congress, Congressional staffers struggle to identify federal elected officials to collaborate with on legislative priorities.
They waste countless hours conducting searches, checking multiple sources, and maintaining excel lists to find the right Members to reach out to. Additionally, existing solutions are expensive, costing up to $6,000 a year per account.
CoalitionBuilder is creating an easy to use platform that aggregates necessary information, such as voting records, co-sponsorships, and committee assignments to produce a list of members who are active on the issue - streamlining the vetting process.
